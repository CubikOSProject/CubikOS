**Program Retainer**  
An interrupt retainer for secure action handling. Programs in user-space can create a secure popup which interrupts any other programs to create safe space for important or sensitive operations, such as scaning QR codes, input username and password. Only main program (and kernel services) could run when the retainer is working. Just like UAC dialog in Windows 7+.
